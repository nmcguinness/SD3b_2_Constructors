# SD3b_2_Constructors
Demonstrates the effect of passing objects (e.g. Point2D) by value, pointer, and reference to a list in terms of what constructors and destructors are called. This code also shows that the list emplace methods may be used to create an object into a list "in-place" thereby removing any copy constructor call.
